### Project Background
Indonesia, an archipelagic nation located in Southeast Asia, is characterized by a diverse climate and geography. The country experiences a tropical climate, with distinct wet and dry seasons. The variability in rainfall patterns poses significant challenges for various sectors, including agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. To address these challenges, this program aims to understanding rainfall patterns across different regions on every month.

The rainfall values in Indonesia typically follow a gamma distribution pattern. Therefore, in this project, the parameter search is conducted to find its probability using parameters from the gamma distribution fitted to climatological data of rainfall in a specific month.

Criteria for rainfall intensity used in Indonesia:
1. 0.5 – 20 mm/day: Light rain
2. 20 – 50 mm/day: Moderate rain
3. 50 – 100 mm/day: Heavy rain
4. 100 – 150 mm/day: Very heavy rain

### Objectives
1. Understanding the characteristics of rainfall in each month in Indonesia
2. Understanding the rainfall patterns in various regions of Indonesia
